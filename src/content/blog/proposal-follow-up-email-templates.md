# Proposal Follow Up Email: 5 Templates That Actually Get Responses

You sent the proposal. It's been three days. Radio silence.

Sound familiar? You're not alone. Studies show that **80% of sales require five follow-ups after the initial contact**, yet 44% of salespeople give up after just one follow-up. For freelancers and consultants, this gap represents thousands of dollars left on the table.

The problem isn't that clients are rejecting your proposals. They're busy. Your email got buried. They meant to respond but forgot. A well-timed, well-crafted follow-up email can be the difference between winning the project and watching it go to someone else.

Here's how to write proposal follow-up emails that get responses — without sounding desperate or pushy.

## Why Following Up Matters

Before we dive into templates, let's address the elephant in the room: many freelancers feel uncomfortable following up. They worry about being annoying or seeming desperate.

Here's the reality: **following up is expected and professional**. Clients appreciate gentle reminders because they're juggling dozens of priorities. Your follow-up shows you're organized, interested, and reliable.

The data backs this up:

- 60% of customers say "no" four times before saying "yes"
- Follow-up emails have a 22% average response rate (higher than cold emails)
- The best time to follow up is 3-5 business days after sending the proposal

## The Anatomy of an Effective Follow-Up Email

Every good follow-up email has four elements:

1. **A clear subject line** — Reference your original proposal
2. **Context** — Remind them briefly what you discussed
3. **Value add** — Give them a reason to engage (insight, resource, or question)
4. **Clear next step** — Make it easy to respond

Keep your follow-up short. Under 150 words is ideal. Long emails feel like work; short emails get replies.

## 5 Proposal Follow-Up Email Templates

### Template 1: The Gentle Check-In (Day 3-5)

Use this for your first follow-up, a few days after sending the proposal.

**Subject:** Following up on [Project Name] proposal

Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in on the proposal I sent over on [date] for [project/service].

I know things get busy, so no pressure — just want to make sure it didn't get lost in the shuffle. Happy to answer any questions or hop on a quick call if that would help.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 2: The Value-Add Follow-Up (Day 7-10)

If your first follow-up didn't get a response, add value with your second one.

**Subject:** Quick thought on [their challenge]

Hi [Name],

Following up on my proposal from last week. While reviewing your project again, I had a thought that might be useful:

[Share one specific insight, idea, or relevant resource related to their project]

This is something we could definitely incorporate into the scope if you'd like. Let me know if you have any questions about the proposal or want to discuss further.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### Template 3: The Timeline Check (Day 10-14)

Use this when you need to understand their decision timeline.

**Subject:** Quick question about timing

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on the [project name] proposal and see where things stand on your end.

No pressure at all — I just have a few projects in the pipeline and want to make sure I can reserve capacity for you if we move forward. Could you give me a sense of your timeline for making a decision?

Either way, I'm happy to answer any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### Template 4: The Decision Deadline (Day 14-21)

When significant time has passed, create gentle urgency.

**Subject:** Proposal status: [Project Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm circling back one more time on the proposal I sent for [project]. I'm planning my schedule for the next month and want to make sure I have availability if you'd like to proceed.

If you've decided to go a different direction, no worries at all — just let me know so I can close out my notes on this one.

And if you're still interested but the timing isn't right, I'm happy to reconnect whenever makes sense.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### Template 5: The Breakup Email (Day 21-30)

This counterintuitive email often gets the best response rates.

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back on my proposal for [project], so I'm guessing the timing isn't right or you've decided to go another direction.

Totally understand — I'll go ahead and close out this opportunity on my end.

If things change in the future, feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to revisit the project with you.

Wishing you all the best with [their goal/project].

Best,
[Your Name]

## When to Send Each Follow-Up

Here's a practical schedule for following up:

| Email | When to Send | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Original proposal | Day 0 | Initial submission |
| Template 1 | Day 3-5 | Gentle reminder |
| Template 2 | Day 7-10 | Add value |
| Template 3 | Day 10-14 | Understand timeline |
| Template 4 | Day 14-21 | Create urgency |
| Template 5 | Day 21-30 | Final attempt |

Don't send all five. Usually 2-3 follow-ups are enough. Read the situation and stop if you get any response — even a "not right now."

## Common Follow-Up Mistakes to Avoid

**Being apologetic**: Don't start with "Sorry to bother you." You're a professional offering valuable services.

**Writing essays**: Keep follow-ups under 150 words. Nobody wants to read paragraphs.

**Following up too fast**: Give them at least 3 business days. Following up 24 hours later feels desperate.

**Not providing a clear ask**: Every email should have an obvious next step or question.

**Generic copy-paste**: Reference specific details from your conversation. Personalization matters.

## Tools to Automate Your Follow-Ups

You don't have to manually track every proposal and calendar reminder. Modern proposal tools like ProposalPilot can:

- Send automatic follow-up sequences
- Notify you when clients open your proposal
- Track which proposals need attention
- Remind you of optimal follow-up timing

This lets you focus on the work while your proposals follow up themselves.

## The Bottom Line

Following up isn't pushy — it's professional. Most proposals don't close on the first send, and that's completely normal. The freelancers and consultants who win more projects are simply the ones who follow up consistently.

Use these templates as starting points, personalize them to your voice, and watch your close rate improve.
